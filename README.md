# 50/50 - Number Guessing
Developed in Fall 2022 for my Python Programming II class, this is a simple Python-based number guessing game where users select a number between 0-100. There is an implemented hint system to guide players toward the correct answer. Utilized GitHub for version control and Visual Studio for development.
